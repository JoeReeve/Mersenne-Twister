    <h2> What is Random?
    </h2>
    <p class = "home-par1"> 
        What do a dice roll, future weather conditions, and quantum mechanics all have in common?<br>
        As far as we humans can tell, these 3 things are all completely random, or at least based on<br>
        conditions we don't yet understand. Anything can be defined as random so long as it is<br>
        "lacking a definite plan, purpose, or pattern." This becomes a rather big problems for<br> 
        computers, since by their deterministic nature they produce predictable outcomes 100% of the<br>
        time; given the same input, a computer will give you the same output, without deviation, every<br>
        time. So how do we get around this problem? Randomness can come in quite handy for<br>
        certain applications, but by their very nature computers cannot be random. The answer is<br>
        pseudorandomness. Although computers can never be truly random, it turns out they're very<br>
        good at faking it.

    <h3> How Can We Fake It?
    </h3>

    <p class = "home-par2">
        Enter pseudorandom number generators. These are algorithms that generates numbers which 
        appear to be random to us humans, but are actually deterministic and predictable. You feed
        the algorithm a starting number called a 'seed,' perform a series of math operations on that
        number, and voila, out comes a number that looks completely random. Common operations done 
        on the numbers are exponentiation and bit-shifts. Because these algorithms are predictable and
        only pseudorandom, if you give it the same seed it will produce the same numbers. Every
        programming language and internet browser has a PRNG built in to conveniently provide random 
        numbers to us when needed. However, not all PRNG algorithms are created equal. There comes a point
        in every algorithm that the numbers will start repeating themselves. The amount of numbers you 
        generate before they start repeating is what is known as the 'period.' A small period is usually
        the sign of a bad algorithm. Another sign of a bad algorithm is if the numbers are not distributed
        equally. For example if could generate large numbers more often than it generates small numbers.
        Every algorithm must strike a balance of appearing random, but also being fast. Being very random
        but very slow is typically not ideal.

    <h4>
        The Mersenne Twister
    </h4>

    <p class ="home-par3">
        A good balance of speed and randomness is where the Mersenne Twister shines. Developed in<br>
        1997 by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura, the MT is one of the most widely used PRNGs<br>
        to date. Excel, Python, and MATLAB are a few examples among many more that all use the <br> 
        Mersenne Twister as the built in PRNG. The name comes from it's period length, which<br>
        is 2<sup>19937</sup>-1, a Mersenne prime, and then 'twisting' (mostly performing bitwise operations) an array<br>
        to generate the pseudo-random numbers. When the Mersenne Twister was published in 1997 it<br>
        corrected a lot of the problems that older PRNGs were suffering from. Today, it still holds<br>
        up as being fast and reliably random for most common use-cases, although some disadvantages<br>
        such as not being cryptographically secure have arisen (newer versions of MT have been<br> 
        published to correct these flaws). All in all, the Mersenne Twister is a fantastic PRNG that<br>
        should be appreciated.
